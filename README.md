chat-app
===
This is a code for a chat application using Flask. This code uses Python 3.8.16-slim and Flask to create a web page for a chatroom. It also uses the datetime module for time stamps. 

The Flask app has two routes: one for general chat and another for specific chat rooms. It also has a route for the GET and POST of the chat messages.

This code will create a log file for each chat room, which will contain all of the messages. The log file name will be "logs_roomname" and it will feature timestamps for each message.

This code also exposes port 5000, so that users can access the chat application.

To run this code, make sure that you have the Python 3.8.16-slim version installed and the required dependencies in the requirmnd.txt file. Then, run the Dockerfile and the chat.py file. 

Once the code is running, you can access the chat application from your browser by entering the IP address and port number. You can then join a general chatroom or create a specific room for yourself.
